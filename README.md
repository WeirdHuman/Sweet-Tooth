# Sweet-Tooth
Sweet-Tooth is a project that was designed for a local boba shop located in the heart of Los Angeles. In this project, HTML5 was implemented for the enhancement of the sematic elements such as **Navigation** tag and **Section** tag. Additionally, Sweet-Tooth was also developed on the core concept of Javascript; **The Fetch API**. In this project, fetch api was used to request a custom created data in JSON format and displaying them to the page. Finally, the project consisted of many important concepts of CSS3 such as **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **reponsive layout**.
